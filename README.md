# Bank Management System

> *Banking Management System is a simple database project in C. It is done using file handling mechanism in C. The record of the customer can be added, updated, searched and deleted. It is simple project made using console application of C. This means, no graphics component are added. The main target user of this project are the C beginners who want to make the project in C and especially those who are interested in File handling. This projects is complete package to learn how to use file as database.*

## DATA STRUCTURE USED 

> Binary Search Tree is used for the data creation because it will be efficient in terms of space and complexity to search records. Also Linked list is used to delete an Account.
___
### ```Task 1:```

#### Customer Registration (Account Number, Name, Age,etc.,) 
- _void filetolist(USER_DETAIL *temp,USER_DETAIL *new)_

   - this function add nodes in a binary search tree of user details
   - tree is made based on account No of the user

- _void validating_account_no(USER_DETAIL *temp,long int acc_no)_

	- this function validate that the account no given is prevoiusly present or not
	- mainly used while creating account by new user to allocate different account no to different users.
	- it is traversing via pre-order traversal
	- if account no found make the flag '0'

- _void Account_No(USER_DETAIL *acc,USER_DETAIL *roothead)_

	- for Generating account number randomly
	- calls the 'validating_account_no()' to validate the new account no generated so that no two user have same account no
	- if that account no does not exist then assign it to the new user
	- else going back to the loop again to generate the account no randomly

- _USER_DETAIL *from_file_to_tree()_
	- reading from file and  creating a tree
	- reading from file line by line
	- calls 'filetolist()' for adding it the binary search tree

- _void Address(int pin,USER_DETAIL *acc,ADDRESS *temp)_
	- checking address from the given pin code
	- traversing in post order and checking the address for the given pin code
	- 4 options are given:
		1. to conferm
			- if confermed the add that address in user details
		2. to check for another
			- if user want to check another address with same pin code
		3. to enter by yourself
			- if user want to enter the address by themself 
		4. to enter another pincode
			- if user want to check for another pin code

- _void validating_username(USER_DETAIL *temp,char user_name[])_
	- to check if that username doesnot exist previously
	- if username found making flag '0' so that program can ask to enter different username
	- traversing in pre-order traversal

- _void Username(USER_DETAIL *acc,USER_DETAIL *roothead)_
	- Asking for username
	- calling 'validating_username()' for validating username
	- if username not found then conferm the username
	- else ask for another username

- _void passwordhide(USER_DETAIL *acc)_
	- to take password and print * in place of password

- _void createadresstree(ADDRESS *temp,ADDRESS *new)_
	- Creating Address Tree
	- binary search tree by pincode

- _ADDRESS *addressinlist()_
	- scaning pincode and address from file
	- calling 'createadresstree()' to add the address in binary tree
	- returns the address for root

- _int validating_email(char A[])_
	- for validating email address
	- retruns 1 if correct else 0

- _USER_DETAIL *NEW_USER(USER_DETAIL *temp)_
	- function to create a new user account
	- will ask the user for
		- Account_type
			- Saving
			- Current
			- Fixed	
		- Name
		- Gender
			- Male
			- Female
			- Others
		- Father's Name
		- DOB(DD/MM/YYYY)
		- Pincode
			- call the 'Address()' function to know the address of that pincode
		- Mobile No
			- validate the Mobile No
		- Email_Id
			- call the 'validating_email()' to validate the email id
		- Opening balance
		- Userame
			- call the 'Username()' to get a valid username
		- password
			- call the 	'passwordhide()' to get password in hidden form
		- account_no
			- calls 'Account_No()' to get a valid account no
	- call 'filetolist()' to add the new user in binary search tree
	- return root pointer of binary search tree

- _void from_tree_to_file(FILE *pas,USER_DETAIL *new_ac)_
	- re-writting the whole tree to file
	- pre-oreder traversal of bst

- _void writingtofile(USER_DETAIL *temp)_
	- call the 'from_tree_to_file()' to re-write the whole tree to file

### Task 2:
- Account Updation 
- Email update 
- Mobile number update(eg. Customer wants update email)

### Task 3:
* Transaction history 
* Searching (eg. search database to find all customers with name “ABCD”.)

### Task 4:
* Deletion  (eg. Removing account by providing the account number)

		void delete1(USER_DETAIL *root,long int n);
			->It needs 2 parameters head pointer and the data to be deleted.
			->deletion involves 3 parts:
				deletion of node having no childs:
					We keep traversing and storing the parent node when node to be deleted is found,we cut the link of this node with the parent node.
				deletion of node having one child:
					We store node which is before parent node in 'p' every time and when the node to be deleted is found,we cut the link of the present node  and join it to 'p'.
				deletion of node having two childs:
					We keep traversing  and if the node to be deleted is found store it ,find the minimum element in right sub tree and now again delete the node with minimum element by recursive call of deletion function.
					Later replace the present node data with the minimum data.
			->We call the function recursively for traversing.

		long int min(USER_DETAIL *root);
			-> This function is used to find  and return the minimum value from right subtree of a binary search tree.

		void delete(USER_DETAIL *temp,long int n);
			->This function calls the delete function of binary search tree, having the head pointer and the data to be deleted as parameters.

		LLIST *createlinkedlist(LLIST *llhead)
			->creating stacks  using linked list 
			->start reading from file and keep creating the stack till end of file

		LLIST* del(LLIST *t,long int n)
