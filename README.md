# Bank Management System

> *Banking Management System is a simple database project in C. It is done using file handling mechanism in C. The record of the customer can be added, updated, searched and deleted. It is a simple project made using console application of C. This means, no graphics component are added. The main target user of this project are the C beginners who want to make the project in C and especially those who are interested in File handling. This project is a complete package to learn how to use the file as a database.*

## DATA STRUCTURE USED 

> Binary Search Tree is used for the data creation because it will be efficient in terms of space and complexity to search records. Also Linked list is used to delete an Account.

## Requirements

* [C](https://gcc.gnu.org/install/binaries.html)

### ```Task 3:```
#### Transaction history 
#### Searching (eg. search database to find all customers with name “ABCD”.)

- _void EXISTING_USER();_
	- If entered Username and Password exist in the userfile asks user for any transactions or updations.
	- As per the option selected by user it calls respective functions.

- _int searchusername(char entry1[],char entry2[]);_
	- entry1 is the username of user.
	- entry2 is for storing password of user.

- _void searchuserintree(char entry1[], char entry2[],USER_DETAIL *root,int flag1);_
	- Here username is searched in binary search tree.
	- If entry1(username) exists in bst then password is stored.

- _void Transaction(char entry1[],USER_DETAIL *root);_
	- entry1 is username of user. 
	- here user can tranfer amount to any account based on his/her account details(accountno). 

- _void updatetransactionfiles(long int sender,long int receiver,int amount);_
	- FILE1 is updated with new transactions with details like sender(accountno), receiver(accountno), amount transfered, and Time(date and timings).

- _void searchintree(char entry1[], USER_DETAIL *root, char accountno[],int flag1);_
	- This function searches entry1(username) in BST and stores the accountno of entry1.

- _int checkaccountno(int an,int s);_
	- If accountno(an) exists in userfile it returns available balance of s(user) else it return 0.

- _void Transactionhistory(char entry1[]);_
	- Asks the user to selects one of given options. If option 1 is selected then it displays all Transaction history of the user.
	- (Using linkedlist) if the account no of user matches it displays details.
	- If 2nd option is selected 'searchbydate' function is called.

- _LLIST *createlinkedlist(LLIST *head);_
	- Input is taken from FILE1(Transaction history file). Head has 4 parts 1.accountno, 2.string1, 3.string2, 4.next

___
### ```Task 4:```
#### Deletion  (eg. Removing account by providing the account number) 

- _void delete1(USER_DETAIL *root,long int n);_
	- It needs 2 parameters head pointer and the data to be deleted.
	- deletion involves 3 parts:
		- deletion of node having no childs:
			- We keep traversing and storing the parent node when node to be deleted is found,we cut the link of - - - _this node with the parent node._
	- deletion of node having one child:
		- We store node which is before parent node in 'p' every time and when the node to be deleted is found,we cut the link of the present node  and join it to 'p'.
	- deletion of node having two childs:
		- We keep traversing  and if the node to be deleted is found store it ,find the minimum element in right sub tree and now again delete the node with minimum element by recursive call of deletion function.
		- Later replace the present node data with the minimum data.
	 	- We call the function recursively for traversing.

- _long int min(USER_DETAIL *root);_
	- This function is used to find  and return the minimum value from right subtree of a binary search tree.

- _void delete(USER_DETAIL *temp,long int n);_
